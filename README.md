## Installation

Most of the time, you have to make small adjustments to a package (e.g., configuration in `Settings.yaml`). Because of
that, it is essential to add the corresponding package to the composer from your theme package. Navigate to this package
in your CLI and run the following command:

```bash
composer require jonnitto/prettyembedvideoplatforms --no-update
```

The `--no-update` command prevent the automatic update of the dependencies. After the package was added to your package
`composer.json`, go back to the root of the Neos installation and run `composer update`. Et voilà! Your desired package
is now installed correctly.

All packages from the PrettyEmbed series have the benefit of a better frontend performance since the player gets only loaded on request. So, no iframe/video gets loaded until the user wants to watch a video.

## Merge PrettyEmbedYoutube and PrettyEmbedVimeo

If you want existing nodes from [PrettyEmbedYoutube] and [PrettyEmbedVimeo] use this package,
you have to run following command in your cli:
`./flow node:migrate --version 20200420033756`

After this migration you have to flush your frontend cache:
`./flow cache:flushone --identifier Neos_Fusion_Content`

## PrettyEmbedCollection

This package is member of the [PrettyEmbedCollection] which contains following packages:

- [PrettyEmbedVideo]
- [PrettyEmbedVideoPlatforms]

If you install the PrettyEmbedCollection, the video players get grouped into an own group in the node-inspector; otherwise, they will be in the default group.
